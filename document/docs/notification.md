### How to Specify Channels and Roles from the REST API
If you would like to have LINE Connect send LINE notifications when posting articles from the REST API, please add the following keys and values to the JSON data.
```
  "lc_channels":{
      "the first four characters of the secret":{
        "roles": ["target role name1", "target role name2"],
        "template": Post ID of LC message or 0(Defult template)
      }
  }
```

For versions 3.2.1 and earlier, the format is as follows 
```
  "lc_channels":{
      "the first four characters of the secret":"Role name (if there are multiple roles, separate them with ",")"
  }
```
