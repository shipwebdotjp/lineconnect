# Direct message
If a LINE user ID is recorded in the event log, such as a user who has added the official account as a friend or sent a message to the official LINE account within 7 days, you can send a LINE text message to that LINE user.  
By clicking on the “Message” link that appears on mouse-over in the User ID column of the Event Log, you can specify the user to send the message to.

While Bulk message targets users who have already been linked, direct messages can be sent to users who have not yet been linked.
