# Direct message
If a LINE user ID is recorded in the event log, such as a user who has added the official account as a friend or sent a message to the official LINE account within 7 days, you can send a LINE text message to that LINE user.  

## How to specify the recipient user
- Click the "Message" link that appears on mouse-over in the User ID column of the Event Log.
- Click the "Message" link in the LINE ID list.
