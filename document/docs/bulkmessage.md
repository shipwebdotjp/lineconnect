# Bulk message
Instead of sending the article content on LINE when submitting an article, you can send a LINE message with the content of your choice as a simple text message.
### Usage
Open the "Bulk message" page from the LINE Connect menu.

#### Channel
Select target channel  

#### Type
Specify which user groups to send to.  
- All: Send to all users who are add as friends, regardless of whether they are linked or not.
- Linked: Send to users who are linked to Wordpress among users who are add as friends.
- Roles: Sends to users who belong to a specific role among the users who have linked with Wordpress.
- Users: Send to each user individually. (How to specify users is described below.)

#### Role  
Select which roles to send to users belonging to.   

#### Message
Enter the contents of the LINE message.

### Specify individual users and send
Since you cannot specify individual users to be sent from the Bulk message page, please specify the target users from the User List page.  

#### To only one user
If the "check box" link in the LINE column takes you to the Bulk message page, the user will be selected.
