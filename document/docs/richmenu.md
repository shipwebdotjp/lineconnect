# Rich menu
You can set different rich menus for linked and unlinked users.

## How to set the rich menu
A rich menu must be created in advance using the API.  
It is recommended that titles be unique and distinguishable.  
â€»Rich menus created in [LINE Official Account Manager](https://manager.line.biz/) cannot be used.  
Creating rich menus using the API is relatively easy with the [Rich Menu Editor](https://richmenu.app.e-chan.me/).
1. set the rich menu on the channel tab in the LINE Connect settings page.  
2. Select rich menus for linked and unlinked friends and for each role from the pull-down menu.  
3. Different rich menus will be displayed depending on the linked status and role.
