# Action Flow
Action flow is the ability to execute multiple actions in succession.  
It also has an action chain function that passes the return value of one action to another.
## Usage scenarios
Action flows are called from the following functions
- When a trigger is fired
- When an action is immediately executed
- During scenario execution

## Actions
The following types of actions are available. It is also possible to add custom actions using filter hooks.
- Actions that retrieve and return information
- Actions that search for information and return it
- Actions that perform operations such as sending messages

Actions are shared with the Function Calling feature used for AI responses.
### Return Value of Actions
#### Send the return value as a response
If checked, the return value of the action will be sent as a response message to the originator of the Webhook event.

The type of message sent varies depending on the type of return value:
- String: Sent as a LINE text message
- Instance of LINE\LINEBot\MessageBuilder: Sent as a LINE message object
- Others: Sent as a dumped LINE text message

:::info
The return value is sent as a response message only when the trigger type is a Webhook event.  
If the trigger type is a schedule, checking this will not send the return value as a LINE message.  
In that case, you can use the action chain feature to set the return value as an argument for the "Send LINE Message" action to send a LINE message to the desired user.

### Embedding Variables
If the argument of the action is a string, each variable can be embedded and used.  

#### Return Values of Actions
The return values of sequentially executed actions can be used in placeholders within the arguments of subsequent actions.  
`{{$.return.action_number}}`  
action_number is the action number in the action chain.  
If the return value of the target action is an array, you can extract a specific value by adding ".key" to the action number.  
Example: Set the "Get Current Date and Time" action to Action-1 (Action Number 1).  
Set the "Get LINE Text Message" action to Action-2 (Action Number 2).  
In the body of the parameters for Action-2, enter "The current time is `{{$.return.1.datetime}}`."  
This will embed the current time in the message and send it.  

#### Webhook Event Data
You can also use data included in received Webhook events.  
`{{$.webhook.eventObjectProperty}}`  
Example: To use the text message sent to the official account  
`{{$.webhook.message.text}}`  
Example) **When using postback data**
You can use the data directly with `{{$.webhook.postback.data}}`.  
When data is in query string format, the parsed data is stored in params.  

Example) **Replying with a specified message ID using postback**
If the data is `action=message&slc_message_id=1354`, you can use `{{$.webhook.postback.params.slc_message_id}}` to get the value "1354".  
By utilizing this, you can create a single common trigger that fires on `action=message`, set the "Get LINE Connect message" action, and inject the desired message ID through action chain. This eliminates the need to create individual triggers for each message.

Example) **Setting profile items using postback**
Create a postback with data `action=profile&key=value` and configure the trigger to fire on `action=profile`.  
Select "Update LINE User Profile" as the action and input `{{$.webhook.postback.params.key}}` for key and `{{$.webhook.postback.params.value}}` for value.

#### User Data
You can use the data of the user who sent the Webhook event.  
`{{$.user.[WPUser object properties]}}`  
Example: Using the display name of a user  
 If the user is already linked to a WordPress user, you can get the display name of the WordPress user; if not, you can get the display name of the LINE user.  
`{{$.user.data.display_name}}`  
The profile of the LINE user (profile image URL, etc.) can be used in `{{$.user.profile.[profile property]}}`.  
The standard available values for profile properties are `displayName`, `pictureUrl`, `language`, and `statusMessage`.  
In addition, you can use your own item names set in the profile update action. 


### Action Chain
If the argument of an action is in the form of an object or a predetermined constant to be selected from, embedding variables is not possible.  
In such cases, a chain rule can be added to inject the return value of any action into the arguments of subsequent actions.  

#### Destination argument to
How to Specify the Target Action Argument for Injection: `ActionNumber.ArgumentName`  
- Action Number: The order of the actions starting from 1  
- Argument Name: The name corresponding to the required argument for each action  
Example: To specify the message of action-2 as the injected argument: `2.message`.  
(Note that it is not necessary to enclose in `{{ }}`)  

#### Data
Data to be injected can be strings or embedded variables.
