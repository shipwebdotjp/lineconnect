# Linking
By linking WordPress users and LINE users, you can identify which WordPress user the inquiry from LINE is coming from, and you can serve rich menus according to the role of WordPress.

## How to linking
There are three ways to start linking accounts. 
1. Add the official account as a friend.
2. Enter the keyword to start linking or unlinking accounts on the official account's talk screen and send it to the account. 
3. Send the postback action "action=link" from the rich menu.

Then, tap the link to start the linking, and log in to Wordpress to linking.
