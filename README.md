## How to install

2. login to the Wordpress administration page, select "Add New" from the "Plugins" menu, and click "Upload Plugin". 
3. From "Select File", select the ZIP file you have downloaded and click "Install Now".

## Initial Setup

2. obtain the Channel Secret from the Basic Settings. 
3. Obtain a Channel Access Token (long-lived) from the Messaging API Settings.

### Webhook URL
1. Set the Webhook URL in Webhook settings as follows
```
https://your-domain/wp-content/plugins/lineconnect/bot.php
```
※Change the your-domain part to your domain name. If your Wordpress URL is not directly under your domain, add the path to your Wordpress directory.
2. Turn on "Use webhook" toggle.

Note: If you only want to send post notifications to all your friends, you do not need to turn on "Use webhook". In that case, the user linking feature will not be available.

### Bot and Chat
BOT and chat can be used together. User inquiries, etc. can be responded to using chat, while user linking and automatic responses via ChatGPT can be used.
1. Login to [LINE Official Account Manager](https://manager.line.biz/).
2. Go to [settings]-[Response settings]. 
3. Turn on "Chat" if manual chat response is required.

### Initial Settings for the Plug-in
1. from the Wordpress admin page, click "LINE Connect" from the settings menu to open the settings page.
2. On the Channels tab, click "Add New Channel".
2. Enter the Channel Name, Channel Access Token and Channel Secret and save.

### If you are changing the login page URL.
By default, this plugin uses Wordpress's default "wp-login.php" as the login URL.
If you have changed the login page URL to another URL, please change the login page URL in the "Link" tab of the settings page.

## How to linking
There are three ways to start linking accounts. 
1. Add the official account as a friend.
2. Enter the keyword to start linking or unlinking accounts on the official account's talk screen and send it to the account. 
3. Send the postback action "action=link" from the rich menu.

Then, tap the link to start the linking, and log in to Wordpress to linking.

## How to send update notification
### Select the post type you want to be notified about
1. select post type you want to be notified about from the Post Types in the Update Notification tab. Custom post types are also supported.
### When posting
1. on the post edit screen, the "LINE Connect" box will appear in the right column, and if you want to be notified, check the "Send update notification" checkbox.  
*If you have checked, notifications will be sent not only of new posts published, but also posts updated.  
*If you check the "Send when a future post is published" checkbox and save it, notifications will be sent to LINE when the future posts are published.
2. If a post has an futured image, notifications will be sent with the image.
3. From the "Send target:" list, select the users to be notified by LINE from "All Friends", "Linked Friends", and each of the roles. You can select multiple targets.

## How to set the rich menu
A rich menu must be created in advance using the API and a rich menu ID must be obtained.  
※Rich menus created in [LINE Official Account Manager](https://manager.line.biz/) cannot be used.  
Creating rich menus using the API is relatively easy with the [Rich Menu Editor](https://richmenu.app.e-chan.cf/).
1. set the rich menu IDs on the LINE Connect settings page.
2. Create and register two types of rich menus, one for friends who are already linked and one for friends who are not linked, and set the IDs in the respective fields to display different rich menus depending on the status of the linking.

```
##### Parameters
**$channel (array|null)**  
Array of channel information with channel-access-token, channel-secret, or null (use default channel)
※The default channel is the registered channel if there is one, or the first channel if there are multiple registered channels.

 Wordpress ID of the user sending the message (Note: this is not a LINE user ID)

Message to be sent. If a string is given, a text message is created and sent; you can also use the LINE BOT SDK to send messages created with MessageBuilder.

#### send_message_to_role($channel, $role, $message)

##### Usage
```
//Send a message to Administrator role 
do_action('send_message_to_role', null, array("administrator"), 'Message from Wordpress');

//Send message to all linked users 
do_action('send_message_to_role', null, array("slc_linked"), 'Message from Wordpress');

```
##### Parameters

**$role (array)**   
Array of role slugs to be sent. Example: array("administrator")

To be sure, specify the channel information as an array or use the channel information obtained from the first four characters of the secret.
```
$channel = lineconnect::get_channel("the first four characters of the secret");
```
### Stored Formats for LINE User IDs
The LINE user ID, display name and profile image URL of the linked user are stored in the user meta with the key name ``line``.
#### Metadata Format
```
//Get user info for user ID 3.
$user_meta_line = get_user_meta(3, 'line', true);
var_dump($user_meta_line);

array(1) {
  ["the first four characters of the secret"]=>
  array(3) {
    ["id"]=>
    string(33) "LINE user ID"
    ["displayName"]=>
    string(12) "display name"
    ["pictureUrl"]=>
    string(135) "profile image URL"
  }
}
```
There is an array at the top level whose keys are the first 4 characters of the channel secret. It contains an array whose keys are ``id``,``displayName``,``pictureUrl``.

### How to Specify Channels and Roles from the REST API
If you would like to have LINE Connect send LINE notifications when posting articles from the REST API, please add the following keys and values to the JSON data.
```
  "lc_channels":{
      "the first four characters of the secret":"Role name (if there are multiple roles, separate them with ",")"
  }
```

### Saving the LINE Notification Log
If the STREAM plug-in is installed and enabled, a log of the type of LINE notification (multicast, push message, broadcast) and how many messages were sent will be recorded in Stream Records for later viewing.

### LINE Chat
Instead of sending the article content on LINE when submitting an article, you can send a LINE message with the content of your choice as a simple text message.
