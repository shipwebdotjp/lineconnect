# Rich menu
You can set different rich menus for linked and unlinked users.

## How to set the rich menu
A rich menu must be created in advance using the API and a rich menu ID must be obtained.  
â€»Rich menus created in [LINE Official Account Manager](https://manager.line.biz/) cannot be used.  
Creating rich menus using the API is relatively easy with the [Rich Menu Editor](https://richmenu.app.e-chan.cf/).
1. set the rich menu IDs on the LINE Connect settings page.
2. Create and register two types of rich menus, one for friends who are already linked and one for friends who are not linked, and set the IDs in the respective fields to display different rich menus depending on the status of the linking.
